Have a look at some of the stories we wrote for our clients during dozens of international,local, and glocal events: https://storify.com/SoMediaSquad *(NB : Storify quietly shut down its centralized platform a few years ago. Sonce then we came back to the roots of the Internet and develop a p2p  mode of production,  privileging FOSS -free and open source software- with a full grasp on the hosting of the contents and data we co-create and manipulate)*.
